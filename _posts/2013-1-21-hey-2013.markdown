I start and stop blogging on a pretty regular cycle. Usually I'm pretty sheepish about this, but this time, I'm embracing it. Who knows what my next blogging burnout/rebirth cycle will look like?

In this iteration, I want to use the blog to document (and to an extent, catalyze) some projects I want to work on and patterns I want to develop:

- Improve my ability to focus and single-task.
- Deepen my understanding of open source tools I use every day, like git, vim, Bash, Django, and Linux
- Get better at Javascript, and productive with C
- Learning golf (really!)
- Finally doing something with the Arduino gathering dust in my closet
- Switching to Linux, and generally an embrace of things open and non-proprietary
