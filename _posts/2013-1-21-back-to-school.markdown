I left something big off the "projects" list in my last post:

13 years ago, I left RIT on academic probation and owing the school several thousand for a bounced check (not one of my prouder moments). I've started the process of enrolling with the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/academicaffairs/cms/">Center for Multidisciplinary Studies</a>, hopefully to finish my degree (though it's more accurate to say I'm starting a new degree, and transfering in my RIT and other credits).  

So, this should be fun ;)
